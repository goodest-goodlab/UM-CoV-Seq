# Samples to exclude
# Optionally, you can list sample IDs 
# that are found in the raw data folder

# If so, list them in the format:
# ["sample-ID1", "sample-ID2"]
# Otherwise, leave as an empty Python list, []

# Mask problematic sites?
# Should sites marked as problematic 
# be reverted to the reference?
# If True/true/TRUE, will mask. 
# If False/false/FALSE, will not
